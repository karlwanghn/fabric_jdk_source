Next, use the FabCar applications to interact with the deployed FabCar contract.
The FabCar applications are available in multiple programming languages.
Follow the instructions for the programming language of your choice:

Java:

  Start by changing into the "java" directory:
    cd java

  Then, install dependencies and run the test using:
    mvn test

  The test will invoke the sample client app which perform the following:
    - Enroll admin and appUser and import them into the wallet (if they don't already exist there)
    - Submit a transaction to create a new car
    - Evaluate a transaction (query) to return details of this car
    - Submit a transaction to change the owner of this car
    - Evaluate a transaction (query) to return the updated details of this car
